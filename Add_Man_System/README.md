## 📁 File Structure

```
Add_Man_System/
├── main.py              # Main application file
├── students.txt         # Raw student data storage (CSV format)
├── students_formatted.txt # Formatted student data for reporting
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- matplotlib library (`pip install matplotlib`)

### Running the Application
```bash
cd Add_Man_System
python main.py
```

### Default Credentials
- Admin ID: `abc`
- Password: `123`

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Object-Oriented Design
- **StudentAdmissionSystem** class with comprehensive methods
- Encapsulation of student data and business logic
- Modular design for easy maintenance and extension

### Data Persistence
- Text file-based storage system
- Two file formats: raw CSV and formatted table view
- Automatic data loading and saving

### Error Handling
- Input validation for marks and branch selection
- Authentication attempts limitation
- File operation error handling

## 📊 Sample Usage

1. **Add Student**: Collects student details, validates marks, calculates fees
2. **View Students**: Displays all students in formatted table
3. **Search Functionality**: Find students by ID, caste, or branch
4. **Statistical Analysis**: View student counts and distribution graphs
5. **Fee Management**: Automatic fee calculation based on caste and program

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

- Database integration (SQLite/MySQL)
- Web-based GUI interface
- Enhanced security with password hashing
- Email notifications
- Batch processing for multiple admissions
- Export functionality (PDF/Excel reports)
